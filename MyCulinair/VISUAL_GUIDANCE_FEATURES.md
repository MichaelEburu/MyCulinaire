## Technical Implementation

### Files Added/Modified
1. **`js/visual-guidance.js`** - Main visual guidance system
2. **`css/styles.css`** - Styling for visual guidance components
3. **`index.html`** - Added script reference
4. **`js/app.js`** - Integrated visual guidance buttons in recipe cards
5. **`visual-guidance-demo.html`** - Demo page showcasing features

### Key Components

#### VisualGuidance Class
```javascript
class VisualGuidance {
    constructor() {
        this.isActive = false;
        this.currentStep = 0;
        this.recipeSteps = [];
        this.cameraStream = null;
        this.overlayElement = null;
        this.techniqueLibrary = this.initializeTechniqueLibrary();
    }
}
```

#### Technique Library
- Pre-defined cooking techniques with visual examples
- Instructions for each technique
- Real-time feedback messages
- Image and GIF references for demonstrations

#### Camera Integration
- Uses `navigator.mediaDevices.getUserMedia()` for camera access
- Mirrored video feed for natural cooking experience
- Error handling for camera access denial
- Automatic cleanup when closing the guide

## Usage Instructions

### For Users

4. **Follow Instructions**: Read on-screen instructions and technique tips
5. **Progress Through Steps**: Use "Next Step" button or let it auto-advance
6. **Get Real-Time Feedback**: Receive encouragement and corrections as you cook

### For Developers
1. **Integration**: The system automatically integrates with existing recipe cards
2. **Customization**: Modify `techniqueLibrary` to add new cooking techniques
3. **Styling**: Update CSS classes for visual customization
4. **Camera Settings**: Adjust camera constraints in `setupCameraAccess()`

## Browser Compatibility
- **Modern Browsers**: Chrome, Firefox, Safari, Edge
- **HTTPS Required**: Camera access requires secure context
- **Mobile Support**: Responsive design for mobile devices
- **Fallback**: Graceful degradation if camera access is denied

## Future Enhancements
1. **Computer Vision Integration**: Real technique recognition using ML models
2. **Voice Commands**: Audio instructions and voice control
3. **Advanced Analytics**: Cooking performance tracking and improvement suggestions
4. **Social Features**: Share cooking sessions and achievements
5. **AR Integration**: Augmented reality overlays for enhanced guidance

## Security & Privacy
- **Local Processing**: Camera feed is processed locally, not sent to servers
- **No Data Storage**: No cooking videos or images are stored
- **User Control**: Users can start/stop camera access at any time
